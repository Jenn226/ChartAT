The chart is a pie chart depicting the responses from a survey of U.S. adults conducted by Pew Research Center from April 20-26, 2020. The survey asks whether states are still holding primaries for the Democratic presidential nomination. The responses are divided as follows:
- 43% say "Yes, states are still holding primaries"
- 41% say "Not sure"
- 14% say "No"
- 1% provided no answer
The chart highlights that a significant portion of Americans at that time were unsure about the status of Democratic primaries.
