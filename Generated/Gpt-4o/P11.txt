The chart is a pie chart that shows the percentage of Indian Americans who have different views on the significance of discrimination against Indian Americans. The chart is titled "How big a problem is discrimination against Indian Americans?" and is based on data from the Pew Research Center. The pie chart is divided into four segments:
1. 48% of respondents believe discrimination against Indian Americans is a "Minor problem."
2. 38% of respondents believe it is "Not a problem."
3. 10% of respondents think it is a "Major problem."
4. 4% of respondents either "Don't Know" or chose not to respond ("DK/Ref").
The chart visually represents these percentages using different colored slices of a pie.
