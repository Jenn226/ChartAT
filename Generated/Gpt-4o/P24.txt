The chart in the image illustrates the results of a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center from February 18 to March 2, 2020, asking U.S. adults about their perception of news organizations' understanding of people like them.
The chart is a pie chart divided into three segments:
1. The largest segment, colored yellow, represents the 59% of respondents who believe that news organizations don't understand people like them.
2. The second-largest segment, colored maroon, represents the 37% of respondents who feel that news organizations do understand people like them.
3. A small gray segment represents the 4% of respondents who did not provide an answer.
