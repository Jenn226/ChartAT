The chart provides data on the reasons homeowners consider installing solar panels at home, focusing on cost savings and environmental benefits. Specific percentages of respondents who identified each reason are as follows:
- 96% of homeowners stated they want to save money on utility bills.
- 87% mentioned helping the environment as a reason.
- 67% indicated they were motivated by the opportunity to get a solar investment tax credit.
- 60% felt that it would be better for their own or their family's health.
The data comes from a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center from October 1-13, 2019, focusing on homeowners who have either installed or seriously considered installing solar panels. Responses from homeowners who did not see these as reasons or did not answer are not included in the chart.
