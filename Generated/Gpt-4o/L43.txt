- In 2015, half the sample was asked about either "global warming" or "global climate change."
- The source of the data is a survey of U.S. adults conducted January 8-13, 2020.
- The context for the increase in concern is provided by the caption: "As Economic Concerns Recede, Environmental Protection Rises on the Publicâ€™s Policy Agenda."
Overall, the chart shows a significant increase in the percentage of U.S. adults who believe that protecting the environment and addressing global climate change should be top priorities for the president and Congress, with more notable growth in concern for climate change from around 2014 onwards.
