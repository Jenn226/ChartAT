The pie chart presents Palestinian views on the best way to achieve statehood, with the data from the Pew Research Center. It is broken down into five sections, each representing a different method:
1. **Armed struggle**: 45%
2. **Voluntary (Vol) combination**: 22%
3. **Negotiations**: 15%
4. **Nonviolent resistance**: 15%
5. **DK (Don't Know)**: 3%
The largest portion of the pie chart, representing 45%, indicates that nearly half of the respondents believe armed struggle is the best way to achieve statehood. The second largest portion, at 22%, favors a combination of methods. Both negotiations and nonviolent resistance are considered effective by 15% of respondents each. Finally, 3% of the respondents are unsure or don't know which method is best.
