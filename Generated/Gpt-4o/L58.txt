The chart titled "Republicans and Democrats consistent in criticism of Iran" shows the percentage of respondents who say they have an unfavorable view of Iran, segmented by political affiliation (Republicans/Lean Republicans versus Democrats/Lean Democrats) from 2009 to 2020. The data comes from the Summer 2020 Global Attitudes Survey, Q8f, conducted by the Pew Research Center.
Key points from the chart include:
1. For Republicans/Lean Republicans (red line):
- The percentage starts at 85% in 2009.
- There is a slight dip to 77% in 2011.
- The percentage rises again to 78% in 2012 and remains relatively stable with minor fluctuations.
- The percentage reaches a peak at 85% again in 2015.
- The percentage drops to 83% in 2019 but slightly rises to 82% in 2020.
2. For Democrats/Lean Democrats (blue line):
- The percentage starts at 73% in 2009.
- There is a consistent decline to 62% from 2010 to 2011.
- A low of 59% is observed in 2013.
- The percentage gradually increases to 72% in 2015.
- The percentage tapers off slightly to 65% in 2019 but then rises to 70% in 2020.
The chart demonstrates that while there are fluctuations over the years, a significant portion of both Republicans and Democrats have held an unfavorable view of Iran, with Republicans having consistently higher unfavorable views compared to Democrats throughout the period.
