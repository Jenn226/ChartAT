The image is a pie chart from the Pew Research Center, based on a survey of U.S. adults conducted between June 16-22, 2020. It illustrates how people in the respondent's area would react if they wore a mask in public places. There are three categories represented by different colors and segments of the pie:
1. **Approve**: 55% of the respondents believe that most people around them would approve of wearing a mask. This segment is depicted with a yellow color and occupies the majority of the pie chart.
2. **Not care**: 40% think that most people wouldnâ€™t have a strong opinion about it, either way. This segment is shown in white and is the second largest portion.
3. **Disapprove**: Only 4% believe that most people around them would disapprove of wearing a mask. This segment is colored purple and is the smallest part of the chart.
Note: The 'No answer' responses are not shown in this chart.
