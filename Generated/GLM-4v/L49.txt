The chart is a line graph from the Pew Research Center that depicts the percentage of U.S. adults who believe either "the worst is still to come" or "the worst is behind us" in relation to the problems facing the country due to the coronavirus outbreak. The data points are shown for three different time periods: April, June, and November.
- In April, 73% of respondents believed the worst was still to come, while 26% thought the worst was behind us.
- By June, this had changed to 59% believing the worst is yet to come and 40% thinking the worst was over.
- In November, the percentages were 71% anticipating more severe impacts ahead and 28% feeling that the worst has passed.
The trend lines show a fluctuation in public opinion with a general decrease in the number of people expecting worse times ahead and an increase in those believing the outbreak's hardest days were behind. Notably, there is a note at the bottom stating that respondents who did not give an answer are not shown in the chart. The source of the survey is cited as being conducted between November 18-29, 2020, and there is also a reference to an article about increasing intent to get a COVID-19 vaccine as confidence in the research and development process rises.
