The image is a line graph from the Pew Research Center depicting the percentage of Americans who have a favorable opinion of NATO, broken down by political party affiliation from 2009 to 2020. There are two lines on the graph: one representing Democrats and lean Democrats (shown in blue), and the other representing Republicans and lean Republicans (shown in red).
Here's a step-by-step description of the chart:
1. **Title**: "Democrats still have more favorable views toward NATO than Republicans do"
2. **Y-Axis**: Percentages ranging from 0% to 100%, with each 20% interval marked.
3. **X-Axis**: Years from 2009 to 2020, with each year marked.
4. **Blue Line (Dem/Lean Dem)**:
- Starts at 60% in 2009 and shows slight fluctuations over the years.
- Reaches its lowest point at 56% in 2014.
- Peaks at 76% in 2018.
- After 2018, there is a decline but it remains above 60%.
5. **Red Line (Rep/Lean Rep)**:
- Begins at 49% in 2009 and generally trends downward over time.
- Reaches its lowest point at 44% in 2014.
- Increases slightly to 51% in 2016 before dropping again.
- Fluctuates around the mid-40s to low-50s range until 2018.
- Declines after 2018, reaching 46% in 2020.
The data source mentioned is the Summer 2020 Global Attitudes Survey, with an additional note that the 2018 results come from a Korber-Stiftung survey conducted in September 2018. The chart clearly illustrates that throughout the period shown, Democrats consistently held a more favorable view of NATO compared to Republicans.
