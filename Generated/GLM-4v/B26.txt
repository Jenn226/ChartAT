The chart is a bar graph that represents the percentage of people who say information and communication technology helps them "a lot" in terms of productivity. There are seven categories listed on the horizontal axis, each corresponding to different types of individuals based on their attitudes towards technology:
1. **All** - This category includes everyone surveyed. It shows that 33% of all respondents feel that technology helps them a lot in increasing their productivity.
2. **Omnivores** - These are individuals who use a wide variety of technologies. 72% of omnivores believe technology significantly aids their productivity.
3. **Connectors** - People who actively share information and collaborate with others electronically. 66% of connectors find technology highly beneficial for their productivity.
4. **Productivity Enhancers** - Those who rely heavily on technology to improve their output. An impressive 83% of these individuals feel that technology has a substantial impact on their productivity.
5. **Connected but Hassled** - Individuals who are connected but may feel overwhelmed by technology. Only 9% of this group thinks technology greatly enhances their productivity.
6. **Light But Satisfied** - People who use technology but don't feel it dramatically affects their productivity. A mere 1% fall into this category.
7. **Indifferents** - Those who are not particularly affected by technology and don't see it as a significant factor in their productivity. 5% of indifferent individuals hold this view.
The bars are color-coded in shades of purple, and the vertical axis indicates the percentage of respondents. The chart visually demonstrates that a higher percentage of individuals who integrate technology more deeply into their work feel it significantly improves their productivity compared to those who do not.
