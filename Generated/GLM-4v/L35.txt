The chart depicts the U.S. teen birth rate, which is defined as births per 1,000 females ages 15-19, over a period from 1940 to 2018.
The y-axis represents the birth rate, with values ranging from 0 to 100. The x-axis indicates the years, spanning from 1940 at the left to 2018 at the right.
The line graph shows a general decline in the teen birth rate over time, with some fluctuations. Notably, there are labels on the graph for specific years:
- In 1940, the rate was 54.1.
- It increased during what is labeled as the "Baby boom years," reaching its peak at 96.3 in 1960.
- After peaking, there is a gradual decline in the rate until around 1990, where it slightly increases again before continuing its downward trend.
- By 2018, the teen birth rate has fallen significantly to 17.4.
