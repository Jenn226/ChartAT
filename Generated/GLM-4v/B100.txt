The chart depicts the average number of correct answers out of 11 on a science knowledge test among different racial and educational groups. It is divided into two main sections: one for those with a college degree or more, and another for those with some college education or less. Within each section, there are three bars representing Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics.
In the first section, which is for individuals with a college degree or more, Whites have an average score of 9.3, Blacks have a score of 5.6, and Hispanics have a score of 7.6.
In the second section, which is for those with some college education or less, Whites have a score of 6.7, Blacks have a score of 3.2, and Hispanics have a score of 4.7.
The chart also includes notes stating that the categories of Whites and Blacks include only non-Hispanics, and that Hispanics can be of any race. All questions in the survey were multiple choice, and for the exact wording of the questions, one should refer to the topline. The source of this data is from a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center between January 7-21, 2019, titled "What Americans Know About Science."
