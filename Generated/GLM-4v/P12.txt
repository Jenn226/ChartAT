The chart is a pie graph representing the distribution of the U.S. foreign-born population in the year 2017, according to different categories of immigrants:
1. **Unauthorized Immigrants**: Represented by the light gray section, they make up 23% of the total and number approximately 10.5 million individuals. These are people who have entered the country without proper legal authorization.
2. **Lawful Permanent Residents**: Shown in the peach color, accounting for 27% of the total with about 12.3 million residents. They have been granted the right to live permanently in the United States but are not yet citizens.
3. **Naturalized Citizens**: The largest segment in brown, comprising 45% of the foreign-born population with roughly 20.7 million individuals. These are former immigrants who have become full U.S. citizens through the naturalization process.
4. **Temporary Lawful Residents**: Displayed in dark gray, making up 5% of the total with an estimated 2.2 million people. This category includes those with visas such as students or workers on temporary assignments.
The total U.S. foreign-born population, combining all these groups, is approximately 45.6 million.
Note: The chart mentions that all numbers are rounded and provides additional information regarding the definition of unauthorized immigrants, which includes some with temporary protection from deportation under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Temporary Protected Status (TPS), as well as pending asylum cases.
