The chart is a bar graph titled "Figure 1. Number of online content types purchased by internet users." It represents the percentage of internet users who have purchased different numbers of online content types.
The x-axis shows the number of online content types, ranging from 1 to 14. Each bar on the y-axis indicates the corresponding percentage of internet users who have purchased that number of content types. For instance:
- 25% of internet users have purchased 1 type of online content.
- 21% have purchased 2 types.
- 15% have purchased 3 types.
- And so on down to 0.4% for those who have purchased 14 types.
