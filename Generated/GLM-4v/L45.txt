The chart is a line graph from Google Trends depicting the relative U.S. search volume for different generations over time. The generations represented are: iGeneration, Post-Millennials, and Generation Z. The vertical axis represents the search volume with values ranging from 0 to 80, while the horizontal axis represents the years from 2014 to 2018.
Here's the step by step description of each generation's performance on the chart:
1. **iGeneration** (shown in yellow):
- Starting at a very low base around 2014, there is almost no search volume for this term.
- Throughout the years, the search volume remains consistently low, hovering just above 1 up until 2017.
- In 2018, there is a slight increase to 3 searches per week on average.
2. **Post-Millennials** (shown in grey):
- This term starts with a search volume of 1 in 2014 and maintains that level through to 2016.
- There is a slight dip to 0 searches in 2017 before rising back to 1 in 2018.
3. **Generation Z** (shown in green):
- The term starts with a search volume of 3 in 2014, indicating some initial interest.
- There is a steady increase each year, reaching 10 searches in 2015, 20 searches in 2016, and then a significant jump to 27 searches in 2017.
- In 2018, there is an even larger spike, showing the highest search volume among all terms at 63 searches per week on average.
The chart suggests that Generation Z has a growing interest or relevance as the subject of online searches compared to the other two generations, which have relatively stable and low search volumes.
Additionally, the note below the chart provides context about how Google Trends data is collected and averaged, clarifying that these values do not reflect absolute numbers of searches but rather a relative measure based on weekly query volume.
