- For the rural area, the bar reaches just above the 2.7 mark.
- In the urban area, the bar is slightly taller, reaching exactly at the 2.8 mark.
- Lastly, for the suburban area, the bar also reaches the 2.8 mark, matching the urban figure.
The chart uses a pale yellow background and employs a consistent dark blue color for all three bars to make them easily distinguishable. The y-axis on the left side of the chart ranges from 1 to 3, though only the numbers 2.8, 2.7, and 2.8 are visible, indicating the possible discrete values of the data presented. There is no legend or additional textual information provided regarding what these numbers represent precisely or any other context about the online activities.
