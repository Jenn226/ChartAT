The image is a line graph from the Pew Research Center depicting the number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests by fiscal year. The years on the x-axis range from '09 to '19, with the number of arrests shown for each year. There are annotations on the graph indicating the arrest numbers for specific fiscal years: 297,898 in '09, 143,099 in '19, and 110,104 in '15.
The chart's title states that ICE arrests went up after Trump took office, but remain lower than during much of Obamaâ€™s tenure. This suggests a comparison between the arrest rates under President Trump and President Obama. Additionally, there is a note at the bottom which clarifies that the chart includes only administrative arrests by ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations and does not include Customs and Border Protection apprehensions. The source of the data is cited as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
