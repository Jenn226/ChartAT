The chart is a bar graph that represents the percentage of different generations who own an electronic book device or e-Book reader, such as a Kindle or Sony Digital Book. The data is broken down into seven categories: Millennials (18-34), Gen X (35-46), Younger Boomers (47-56), Older Boomers (57-65), Silent Gen. (66-74), G.I. Gen. (75+), and All adults (18+). Each category has a corresponding blue bar that indicates the percentage of ownership for that group.
Here are the specific percentages for each group:
- Millennials: 5%
- Gen X: 5%
- Younger Boomers: 7%
- Older Boomers: 3%
- Silent Gen.: 6%
- G.I. Gen.: 2%
- All adults (combined): 5%
