The image is a pie chart from the Pew Research Center, based on a survey of U.S. adults conducted between June 16-22, 2020. It represents the percentage of people who believe the 2020 census will be successful in accurately counting the number of people living in the United States.
The chart is divided into four categories:
1. "Somewhat successful" - This category comprises 60% of the respondents and is represented by the largest segment of the pie chart, colored in dark green.
2. "Not too successful" - accounting for 26% of the responses, this section is shown in a light yellow color.
3. "Very successful" - Only 8% of those surveyed believe the census will be very successful, depicted in a teal shade.
4. "Not at all successful" - A minority, 5%, think the census will not be successful at all, indicated by a small segment in mustard yellow.
5. There is also a category labeled "No answer," which includes 1% of the respondents, represented by a tiny sliver of grey in the chart.
Overall, the majority of the respondents expect the census to be somewhat successful in its population count.
