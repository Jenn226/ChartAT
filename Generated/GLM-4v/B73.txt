The chart is a bar graph from the Pew Research Center that depicts the percentage of U.S. adults who correctly identified whether three or more out of six news sources do original reporting based on their perceived importance of following the news. There are three categories of respondents: those who consider following the news 'Very important' (55%), those who consider it 'Somewhat important' (44%), and those who consider it 'Not too/at all important' (32%). The chart suggests a correlation between the perceived importance of following the news and the accuracy in identifying original reporting sources.
