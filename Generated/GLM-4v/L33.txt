The chart depicts the total size of the U.S. active duty force from 1990 to 2017. It is a line graph with the y-axis representing the number of military personnel, ranging from 0 to 2.5 million, and the x-axis indicating the years.
The data points on the graph are as follows:
- In 1990, the size of the U.S. active duty force was 2,065,597.
- By 2001, following the 9/11 terrorist attack, it had decreased to 1,404,215.
- By 2017, the force further reduced to 1,335,120.
The trend shown in the chart indicates a considerable downsizing of the U.S. military in the post-Cold War era. Additionally, the note at the bottom specifies that the chart includes the four military branches of the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security's active duty Coast Guard. Data labels for the years 1990, 2001, and 2017 are specifically mentioned. The source of this information is cited as the U.S. Department of Defense annual Demographics Report from 1990 to 2017.
