The image is a line graph from the Pew Research Center that depicts the changing opinions of China among U.S. adults over a period from 2005 to 2020. There are two lines on the graph representing two different metrics:
1. Unfavorable Opinion: This metric shows the percentage of U.S. adults who have an unfavorable opinion of China. It starts at 35% in 2005, peaks at 55% in 2014 and 2017, dips slightly around 2016, then rises again to reach 66% by 2020.
2. Favorable Opinion: This metric represents the percentage of U.S. adults who have a favorable opinion of China. It begins at 29% in 2005, sees some fluctuations, reaches its highest point at 52% in 2008, then declines steadily until it reaches 26% by 2020.
The x-axis of the graph indicates years, while the y-axis represents percentages of respondents. Notably, the note at the bottom states that "Don't know" responses were not shown in the chart. Additionally, there is a source citation indicating that the data was collected through a survey conducted between March 3-29, 2020, and is titled "U.S. Views of China Increasingly Negative Amid Coronavirus Outbreak."
