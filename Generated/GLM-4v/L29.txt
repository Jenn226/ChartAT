The chart depicts the immigrant share of the U.S. population nearing a historic high, specifically as a percentage of the total U.S. population that is foreign born.
The x-axis represents years, ranging from 1850 to 2018. The y-axis shows the percentage of the foreign-born population in the U.S., starting at 0% and increasing to just over 15%. There are two data points highlighted with circles: one at 9.7% for the year 1960, and another at 14.8% for the year 2010.
Annotations on the chart indicate that there was a significant event in 1965, when the Immigration and Nationality Act was passed. Additionally, there's a note at the bottom indicating that the source of the data is the U.S. Census Bureau's "Historical Census Statistics on the Foreign-Born Population of the United States: 1850-2000" and Pew Research Center tabulations of 2010-2018 American Community Survey (IPUMS). The chart also carries the logo of the Pew Research Center.
