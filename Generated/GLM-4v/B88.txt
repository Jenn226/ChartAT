The chart is a bar graph from the Pew Research Center, depicting the percentage of U.S. adults who believe that global climate change is currently affecting their local community to varying degrees.
The data is segmented by distance from a coastline:
- For those living less than 25 miles from a coastline, 67% say climate change is affecting their local community a great deal or some.
- For those living between 25-299 miles away, 59% hold this view.
- Among those residing more than 300 miles away from a coastline, 50% perceive the impact of climate change on their locality.
The overall figure for all U.S. adults stands at 59%. This suggests that a majority of the surveyed population across different distances from coastlines are aware of the effects of climate change in their communities.
