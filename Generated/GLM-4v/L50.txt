The chart is a line graph depicting the percentage of adult unauthorized immigrants in the U.S., categorized by their duration of residence in the country. There are two lines on the graph: one representing individuals who have resided in the U.S. for more than 10 years, and the other for those who have resided for 5 years or less.
The data points for the "More than 10 years" category start at 36% in 1995, show some fluctuations, and reach up to 64% in 2017. For the "5 years or less" category, the percentage starts at 33% in 1995, decreases to 30% in 2005, further drops to 23% in 2010, and then declines steadily to 20% by 2017.
Overall, the graph indicates a decline in the percentage of short-term residents (those here for 5 years or less) and a rise in the percentage of long-term residents (those here for more than 10 years) among the U.S. unauthorized immigrant population from 1995 to 2017.
