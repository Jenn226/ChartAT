The imprisonment rate started at 331 in 1988 and showed a general increasing trend over the next two decades, reaching its peak at 670 in 2007. After that, there was a decline, with the rate dropping to 555 by 2018.
The source of this data is cited as the Bureau of Justice Statistics, and it's noted that the chart specifically references sentenced prisoners, which are those individuals who have been sentenced to more than a year in state or federal prison.
