1. **Percentage of U.S. Latino Adults Who Have Heard of Latinx:** 76% of the respondents have not heard of the term Latinx. This is represented by the largest segment of the pie, covering almost the entire circle.
2. **Percentage of U.S. Latino Adults Who Use Latinx:** Only 3% of the respondents use the term Latinx. This is shown as a small sliver on the right side of the chart.
3. **Percentage of U.S. Latino Adults Who Do Not Use Latinx:** 20% of the respondents do not use the term Latinx. This is illustrated by a smaller section towards the left side of the chart.
