1. To save money on utility bills - 96%
2. To help the environment - 87%
3. To get a solar investment tax credit - 67%
4. It would be better for my own/my family's health - 60%
The data is based on homeowners who have already installed or given serious thought to installing solar panels at home. Reasons not mentioned by respondents or those who did not answer are not shown in the chart. The survey was conducted from October 1-13, 2019.
