The image depicts a bar chart that presents data on cell phone ownership across different generations in the United States. Here's the step-by-step description:
1. **Title**: "Do you have a cell phone, or a Blackberry or iPhone or other device that is also a cell phone?"
2. **Source**: Pew Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project, from August 9–September 13, 2010 Tracking Survey.
3. **Sample Size**: N=3,001 adults 18 and older, including 1,000 reached via cell phone. Interviews were conducted in English (n=2,804) and Spanish (n=197).
4. **Chart Details**:
- **X-Axis (Horizontal)**: Categories of adults based on their age group: Millennials (18-34), Gen X (35-46), Younger Boomers (47-56), Older Boomers (57-65), Silent Gen. (66-74), G.I. Gen. (75+), and All adults (18+).
- **Y-Axis (Vertical)**: Percentage of respondents who own a cell phone, ranging from 0% to 100%.
- **Bars Representing Each Group**:
- Millennials: 95%
- Gen X: 92%
- Younger Boomers: 86%
- Older Boomers: 84%
- Silent Gen.: 68%
- G.I. Gen.: 48%
- All adults: 85%
The bars are color-coded with varying shades of blue for each generation category except for the 'All adults' which is represented by a gray bar. The chart visually shows that younger generations have a higher percentage of cell phone ownership compared to older generations.
