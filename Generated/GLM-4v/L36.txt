The image is a line graph from the Pew Research Center depicting the average number of people per household in the United States over several decades, specifically from 1790 to 2018. Here are the details:
- **Title**: "This decade will likely be the first in at least 160 years in which American households have more people"
- **Y-Axis**: Represents the average number of people per household.
- **X-Axis**: Indicates the years, with markers at 1790, 1850, 1900, 1950, and 2000 with an additional note for '18', suggesting data up to that year.
- **Data Points**:
- 1790: 5.79 people per household
- 1850: 5.55 people per household
- 2010: 2.63 people per household
- 2018: 2.58 people per household
- **Note**: Data labels are for 1790, 1850, 2010, and 2018. Average household size is not available for the years between 1790 and 1850.
- **Source**: Pew Research Center analysis of Census historical statistics, 2010 Census SF1 data, and 2018 American Community Survey.
The trend shown on the graph indicates a significant decrease in the average household size over time, starting from around 5.79 people in the late 18th century to just under 2.6 people by 2010, with a slight decline observed in the most recent years up to 2018.
