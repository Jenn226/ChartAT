The chart is a bar graph from the Pew Research Center that depicts the self-perceptions of adults with a multiracial background regarding their openness to and understanding of other cultures and races. It shows the percentage of such individuals who feel that their multiracial background made them more open to other cultures, more understanding of people from different racial backgrounds, or like a "bridge" between different racial groups.
The data reveals:
- 59% of multiracial adults felt more open to other cultures because of their background.
- 55% felt more understanding of people from different racial backgrounds.
- 19% felt they acted as a "bridge" between different racial groups due to their heritage.
The note at the bottom of the chart specifies that "Multiracial adults include those who are two or more races based on background of self, parents or grandparents." The source of this information is cited as a survey conducted among U.S. multiracial adults from February 6 to April 6, 2015.
