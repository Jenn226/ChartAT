The image is a line graph from the Pew Research Center depicting the world population growth projections for the coming decades. Here's a step-by-step explanation of its specific content:
1. **Title**: "World population growth is projected to flatten in coming decades"
2. **Y-Axis (Vertical Line)**: Represents the world population, measured in billions.
3. **X-Axis (Horizontal Line)**: Indicates time periods, specifically the years 1950, 2000, 2050, and 2100.
4. **Data Points**: There are three data points plotted on the line graph corresponding to the years 1950, 2020, and 2100.
- For the year 1950, the population is indicated as 2.5 billion.
- For the year 2020, the population is indicated as 7.8 billion.
- For the year 2100, the projected population is indicated as 10.9 billion.
5. **Trend**: The line graph shows an upward trend, indicating that the world population has been increasing over these decades and is expected to continue increasing up to 2100.
6. **Source**: The source of the data is cited at the bottom of the image as the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division, "World Population Prospects 2019."
7. **Note**: A note at the bottom indicates that only data labels for the years 1950, 2020, and 2100 are shown on the graph.
The overall message conveyed by this chart is one of continued global population growth, with a particular emphasis on the expectation that the rate of increase will slow down or "flatten" in the future.
