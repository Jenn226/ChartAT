The image is a pie chart representing the results of a survey conducted by Pew Research Center in collaboration with The Washington Post. It shows the opinions of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents on whether they would like to see other Democratic candidates challenge Barack Obama for the party's nomination for president in 2012.
The chart is divided into three segments, each representing the percentage of respondents who answered "Yes," "No," and "Don't know" respectively:
- **59%** indicated "No, do not challenge," which is represented by the darkest segment of the pie chart.
- **32%** said "Yes, challenge Obama," shown in the medium-colored section.
- **9%** were unsure or did not have an opinion, depicted by the lightest colored segment.
Overall, the majority of respondents did not want to see other candidates challenge President Obama for the nomination.
