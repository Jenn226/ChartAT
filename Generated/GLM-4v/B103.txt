The chart is a bar graph from the Pew Research Center that presents data on the experiences of LGBT individuals when telling their mothers and fathers about their sexual orientation or gender identity.
For telling their mother, the chart shows:
- 40% of all LGBT individuals found it not difficult to tell their mother.
- 59% found it difficult to tell their mother.
For telling their father, the chart shows:
- 34% of all LGBT individuals found it not difficult to tell their father.
- 65% found it difficult to tell their father.
The chart uses two different shades of green for the bars representing "not difficult" and "difficult," respectively. It also includes a note at the bottom which explains that the results are based on those who have told their mother/father about their sexual orientation or gender identity. The sample sizes mentioned are: for mothers, all LGBT n=648; for fathers, all LGBT n=435. Additionally, the chart notes that the responses from individuals who did not answer the questions are not shown.
