The chart displays the number of reported anti-Semitic acts in France by year from 2011 to 2018. The data is presented as a bar graph with each bar representing a year and its corresponding number of reported acts.
The specific data points shown are:
2011: 389 acts
2012: 615 acts
2013: 423 acts
2014: 851 acts
2015: 808 acts
2016: 335 acts
2017: 311 acts
2018: 541 acts
The 2018 bar is colored orange, while the rest are in a light beige color.
The chart notes that the figures include acts against both people and property. The source of the data is cited as the Commission Nationale Consultative des Droits de l'Homme (CNCDH) and the Ministère de l'Intérieur, France.
The graph shows fluctuations in the number of reported anti-Semitic acts over the years, with peaks in 2014 and 2015, followed by a decline in 2016 and 2017, and then an increase again in 2018.
