This chart displays the number of online activities done on a typical day by home broadband users in December 2005, categorized by rural, urban, and suburban areas.
The data is presented as a bar graph with three vertical bars:
1. Rural users performed an average of 2.7 online activities per day.
2. Urban users engaged in 2.8 online activities per day.
3. Suburban users also averaged 2.8 online activities per day.
The y-axis ranges from 0 to 3 in increments of 0.2, while the x-axis categorizes the three location types.
The bars for urban and suburban areas are slightly taller than the rural bar, indicating a small difference in online activity between rural areas and more populated regions. However, the difference is minimal, with all three categories showing between 2.7 and 2.8 activities per day.
The chart's title and data suggest this information is specific to home broadband users in December 2005, providing a snapshot of internet usage patterns across different settlement types at that time.
