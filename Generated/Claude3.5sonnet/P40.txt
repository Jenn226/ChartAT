This image shows a pie chart depicting the percentage of U.S. adults who have ever spoken with or been interviewed by a local journalist. The chart's title states "Most Americans have never spoken with a local journalist."
The pie chart is divided into three segments:
1. "No" - 78% (shown in yellow)
2. "Yes" - 21% (shown in maroon)
3. "No answer" - 1% (shown in light gray)
The chart clearly illustrates that a large majority (78%) of U.S. adults have never spoken with a local journalist, while only about one-fifth (21%) have had such an experience.
Below the chart, there's a source note stating that this survey was conducted from October 15 to November 8, 2018. The image is credited to the PEW RESEARCH CENTER at the bottom.
