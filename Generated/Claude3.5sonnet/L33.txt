This chart shows the total size of the U.S. active duty military force from 1990 to 2017. The graph illustrates a significant downsizing trend in the post-Cold War era.
Key points from the chart:
1. In 1990, the total force size was 2,065,597.
2. There's a sharp decline between 1990 and 1995.
3. By 2000, the force size had decreased to 1,404,215.
4. The chart notes the 9/11 terrorist attack in 2001.
5. After 2001, there's a slight increase and then a gradual decline.
6. By 2017, the force size was 1,335,120.
The chart includes data from the four military branches of the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security active duty Coast Guard.
The source of this data is cited as the U.S. Department of Defense annual Demographics Report, 1990-2017, and the chart was created by the Pew Research Center.
The graph effectively illustrates the overall trend of military downsizing in the U.S. since the end of the Cold War, with a notable impact of the 9/11 attacks causing a temporary increase in force size.
