This image shows a pie chart depicting the percentage breakdown of U.S. gun deaths by type in 2017. The chart is titled "Suicides accounted for six-in-ten U.S. gun deaths in 2017."
The pie chart is divided into three sections:
1. Suicide: 60% (colored in teal)
2. Murder: 37% (colored in yellow)
3. Other: 3% (colored in gray)
Below the chart, there's a note explaining that "Other" includes gun deaths that were unintentional, involved law enforcement, or had undetermined circumstances.
The source of this data is cited as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The chart was created by the Pew Research Center, as indicated at the bottom of the image.
This visualization effectively illustrates that suicide was the leading cause of gun deaths in the U.S. in 2017, accounting for 60% of all gun-related fatalities, while homicides made up just over one-third of the total.
