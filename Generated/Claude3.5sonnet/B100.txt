This chart presents data on science knowledge scores among different racial/ethnic groups and education levels in the United States. The data is presented as the mean number of correct answers out of 11 questions.
The chart is divided into two main sections:
1. Among those with a college degree or more:
- White: 9.3
- Black: 5.6
- Hispanic: 7.6
2. Among those with some college education or less:
- White: 6.7
- Black: 3.2
- Hispanic: 4.7
The data shows that across both education levels, White respondents scored higher than Black and Hispanic respondents. Additionally, those with a college degree or more scored higher within each racial/ethnic group compared to those with some college education or less.
The chart includes notes specifying that Whites and Blacks include only non-Hispanics, while Hispanics can be of any race. It also mentions that all questions were multiple choice.
The source of this data is cited as a survey conducted from January 7-21, 2019, titled "What Americans Know About Science" by the Pew Research Center.
