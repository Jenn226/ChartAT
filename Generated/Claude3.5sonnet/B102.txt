This chart shows the percentage of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters who had a positive impression (excellent or good) of their party's candidates running for the Democratic nomination in various election years.
The data is presented for five different time periods:
- January 2020: 64%
- January 2008: 78%
- January 2004: 46%
- February 1992: 45%
- January 1988: 37%
The chart illustrates that the approval rating in January 2020 (64%) is relatively high compared to most previous years shown, but not as high as it was in January 2008 (78%).
The title of the chart, "Democrats positive about their party's 2020 field, but it's not 2008," reflects this comparison.
The chart also includes a note explaining that surveys conducted in 2008 and prior were done over the phone, and that the 1988 data specifically refers to all adult Democrats and Democratic leaners.
The source of the data is cited as a survey of U.S. adults conducted from January 6-19, 2020, by the Pew Research Center.
