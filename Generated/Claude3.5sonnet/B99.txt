This chart presents data from a survey of U.S. multiracial adults conducted by the Pew Research Center from February 6 to April 6, 2015. The chart shows how multiracial adults perceive the impact of their multiracial background on their attitudes and interactions with other cultures and races.
The data is presented in three categories:
1. "More open to other cultures" - 59% of respondents felt this way
2. "More understanding of people of different racial backgrounds" - 55% of respondents agreed
3. "Like a 'bridge' between different racial groups" - 19% of respondents identified with this statement
The percentages represent the proportion of adults with a multiracial background who said their multiracial background made them feel a certain way.
The chart also includes a note explaining that multiracial adults in this context include those who are two or more races based on the background of self, parents, or grandparents.
The title of the chart emphasizes that majorities of multiracial adults saw themselves as more open to and understanding of other cultures and races.
