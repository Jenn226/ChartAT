This image shows a pie chart presenting survey results on how U.S. adults perceive the impact of climate change on their local communities. The chart breaks down responses into four categories:
1. "A great deal": 22% of respondents
2. "Some": 39% of respondents
3. "Not too much/not at all": 38% of respondents
4. "No answer": 1% of respondents
The chart highlights that a majority (62%) of U.S. adults say climate change is affecting their community at least some, which is the sum of those who responded "A great deal" and "Some."
The title of the chart states "A majority of U.S. adults say climate change is affecting their local community at least some."
