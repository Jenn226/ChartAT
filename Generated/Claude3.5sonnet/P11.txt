This chart is a pie graph showing the results of a survey asking Indian Americans about their perception of discrimination against their community. The chart breaks down the responses into four categories:
1. Minor problem: 48% of respondents
2. Not a problem: 38% of respondents
3. Major problem: 10% of respondents
4. DK/Ref (which likely stands for "Don't Know" or "Refused to answer"): 4% of respondents
The title of the chart asks "How big a problem is discrimination against Indian Americans?" and indicates that the data represents the percentage of Indian Americans who provided each response.
The chart uses different shades of brown and orange to distinguish between the four categories. The largest segment is "Minor problem" at nearly half of the responses, followed by "Not a problem" at over a third. Only 10% view discrimination as a major problem according to this data.
