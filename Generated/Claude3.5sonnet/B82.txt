This chart presents data on legislators' Twitter usage across five countries: the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The data was collected from January 1 to June 30, 2019.
The chart shows two key statistics:
1. 77% of legislators have a Twitter account.
2. 73% of legislators tweeted during the study period.
The study included 2,180 legislators with Twitter accounts, of which 2,056 tweeted at least once during the six-month period.
The title of the chart states "Most legislators in five countries are on Twitter," which is supported by the data showing that over three-quarters of legislators have Twitter accounts.
The source of this information is cited as "For Global Legislators on Twitter, an Engaged Minority Creates Outsize Share of Content" from the Pew Research Center.
This chart illustrates the significant adoption of Twitter as a communication platform among legislators in these English-speaking countries, with a high percentage both having accounts and actively using them during the study period.
