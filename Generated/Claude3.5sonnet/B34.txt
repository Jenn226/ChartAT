The source of the data is cited as a Pew Internet & American Life Project survey conducted from March 26-April 29, 2009. It's noted that the survey is based on all adult internet users (n=1,687) with a margin of error of +/-3%. There's an additional note that the podcast downloading data comes from a different time period (April 8-May 11, 2008) with a slightly different sample size (n=1,553).
