This chart shows the number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests by fiscal year from 2009 to 2019. The graph depicts a line that starts high in 2009 at 297,898 arrests, then declines sharply over the years, reaching a low point of 110,104 arrests in 2015. After 2015, there's a slight uptick, with the number rising to 143,099 arrests in 2019.
The title of the chart states that ICE arrests increased after Trump took office but remained lower than during much of Obama's tenure. The y-axis shows the number of arrests, while the x-axis shows fiscal years in two-year increments from '09 to '19.
The chart includes a note explaining that it only includes administrative arrests by ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations, and does not include Customs and Border Protection apprehensions. The source of the data is cited as the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the chart is credited to the Pew Research Center.
