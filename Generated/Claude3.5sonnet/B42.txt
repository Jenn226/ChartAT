This chart shows the percentage of married couples where the husband is the breadwinner and the wife is a homemaker, broken down by the age of the wife. The data is presented as a bar graph with five categories:
1. "All" couples: 24%
2. Wife aged 18-29: 32%
3. Wife aged 30-49: 27%
4. Wife aged 50-64: 22%
5. Wife aged 65+: 14%
The y-axis represents the percentage of married couples, while the x-axis shows the different age groups. The bars are colored in shades of teal, with the "All" category being the darkest.
The chart is titled "Breadwinner Husband-Homemaker Wife Marriages, by Age of Wife" and includes a note explaining that it's based on the employment status of couples, measured as of the previous week.
The source of the data is cited as "Pew Research Center analysis of 2011 American Time Use Survey data, IPUMS."
This visualization illustrates how the traditional breadwinner-homemaker model varies across different age groups of married women.
