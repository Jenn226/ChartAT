This chart compares the percentages of Republicans and Democrats who believe human activity contributes significantly to global climate change, based on their level of science knowledge.
The data is presented in a bar graph format, with six bars total - three for Republicans and three for Democrats, each corresponding to low, medium, and high levels of science knowledge.
For Republicans:
- Low science knowledge: 25%
- Medium science knowledge: 25%
- High science knowledge: 17%
For Democrats:
- Low science knowledge: 41%
- Medium science knowledge: 74%
- High science knowledge: 89%
The chart clearly shows that among Democrats, the percentage who believe human activity contributes greatly to climate change increases significantly with higher levels of science knowledge, rising from 41% for those with low knowledge to 89% for those with high knowledge.
In contrast, for Republicans, the percentages remain relatively low across all levels of science knowledge, and actually decrease slightly for those with high science knowledge (from 25% to 17%).
The title emphasizes that there's a stark difference between the two parties, particularly among those with high science knowledge.
The chart also includes notes about the methodology, including that the survey was conducted in October 2019, and that science knowledge levels were based on an 11-item index from a survey in January 2019.
