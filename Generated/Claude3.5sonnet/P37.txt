This chart presents the results of a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center from January 7-21, 2019, titled "Trust and Mistrust in Americans' Views of Scientific Experts."
The main finding, highlighted in the title, is that six-in-ten (or 60%) of U.S. adults believe scientists should take an active role in policy debates about scientific issues.
The chart is a pie graph showing the breakdown of U.S. adults' opinions on the role scientists should play in public policy debates about scientific issues:
1. 60% say scientists should "Take an active role in policy debates" (represented by a blue slice)
2. 39% say scientists should "Focus on establishing sound scientific facts" (represented by a green slice)
3. 1% gave no answer (represented by a small gray slice)
The question posed to survey respondents, as indicated in the subtitle, was about what scientists should do "when it comes to public policy debates about scientific issues."
This visualization effectively illustrates the majority opinion that scientists should be actively involved in policy discussions, while also showing a significant minority who believe scientists should focus solely on establishing facts.
