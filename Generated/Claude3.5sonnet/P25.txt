This chart illustrates the first wave of employment loss in the U.S. during the COVID-19 crisis, specifically from February to March 2020. The key points are:
1. The title states that most job losses were from positions that could not be done remotely.
2. A pie chart shows the breakdown of job losses:
   - 90% of lost jobs could not be teleworked
   - 10% of lost jobs could potentially be teleworked
3. The total employment loss during this period was 2.9 million jobs.
4. The chart specifies that these estimates refer to employed workers ages 16 and older, and the data is nonseasonally adjusted.
5. The source of this data is cited as Pew Research Center analysis of Current Population Survey data.
This visualization effectively demonstrates that the vast majority of initial job losses during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic were in sectors where remote work was not feasible, highlighting the disproportionate impact on certain types of employment.
