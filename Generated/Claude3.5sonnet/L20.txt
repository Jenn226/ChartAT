This chart shows the projected world population growth from 1950 to 2100. The title states that world population growth is expected to flatten in coming decades. The y-axis represents world population in billions, while the x-axis shows the years from 1950 to 2100.
The chart displays a curved line graph with three data points labeled:
1. In 1950, the world population was 2.5 billion.
2. In 2020, the population reached 7.8 billion.
3. By 2100, it's projected to reach 10.9 billion.
The line shows a steep increase from 1950 to 2020, but then the growth rate slows down significantly between 2020 and 2100, illustrating the "flattening" mentioned in the title.
The source of the data is cited as the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division, from their "World Population Prospects 2019" report.
The chart is credited to the Pew Research Center at the bottom.
