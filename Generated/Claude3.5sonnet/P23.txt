This chart is a pie graph illustrating teachers' opinions on how digital technologies impact their ability to shape or improve student writing. The data comes from a Pew Research Center survey conducted in 2012.
The chart breaks down responses into three categories:
1. "Easier" - 50% of respondents believe digital technologies make it easier to shape or improve student writing.
2. "More difficult" - 18% of respondents find it more difficult with digital technologies.
3. "No impact" - 31% of respondents believe digital technologies have no impact on shaping or improving student writing.
The largest segment of the pie chart, colored in dark blue, represents the 50% who find it easier. The smallest segment, in light blue, represents the 18% who find it more difficult. The medium-sized segment in gray represents the 31% who see no impact.
The chart's title and subtitle provide context for the question asked in the survey. The source information at the bottom specifies that this data is based on a survey of 2,067 middle and high school teachers conducted from March 7 to April 23, 2012.
