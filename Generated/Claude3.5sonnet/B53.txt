This chart displays cell phone ownership rates across different generational groups in the United States. The data is from a Pew Research Center survey conducted in 2010. Here's a breakdown of the percentages for each group:
1. Millennials (18-34): 95%
2. Gen X (35-46): 92%
3. Younger Boomers (47-56): 86%
4. Older Boomers (57-65): 84%
5. Silent Gen. (66-74): 68%
6. G.I. Gen. (75+): 48%
The chart also shows an overall figure for all adults (18+) at 85%.
The percentages represent the proportion of each age group that owns a cell phone, Blackberry, iPhone, or other device that also functions as a cell phone.
The data shows a clear trend of decreasing cell phone ownership as age increases, with the highest adoption rate among Millennials and the lowest among the G.I. Generation (75+).
