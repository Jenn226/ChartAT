This chart shows how concerns about infectious diseases increased as COVID-19 spread in the United States. It presents data on the percentage of people who consider the spread of infectious diseases a major threat to the US.
The chart displays two data points:
1. March 3-12: 73% of respondents viewed infectious diseases as a major threat
2. March 13-29: This percentage increased to 84%
The data comes from a survey of US adults conducted from March 3-29, 2020. The title of the study is mentioned as "Americans See Spread of Disease as Top International Threat, Along With Terrorism, Nuclear Weapons, Cyberattacks".
The chart is created by the Pew Research Center, as indicated at the bottom.
This visualization effectively shows how public perception of the threat posed by infectious diseases increased significantly over a short period in March 2020, coinciding with the early spread of COVID-19 in the United States.
