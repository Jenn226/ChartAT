This chart shows the results of a survey conducted among Nigerian adults regarding their satisfaction with how democracy is working in their country. The data is presented in a pie chart format.
The chart breaks down the responses into three categories:
1. "Not satisfied" - 60% of respondents
2. "Satisfied" - 39% of respondents
3. "Don't know" - 1% of respondents
The title of the chart states "Nigerians unsatisfied with how their democracy works", which is supported by the majority (60%) expressing dissatisfaction.
The survey question asked was "How satisfied are you with the way democracy is working in our country?"
The source of this data is cited as a "Survey of Nigerian adults conducted June 25-July 30, 2018. Q4." by the PEW RESEARCH CENTER.
The chart effectively visualizes the significant gap between those who are not satisfied and those who are satisfied with the state of democracy in Nigeria, with a very small portion undecided.
