This chart shows the percentage of adults who currently have outstanding student loan debt for their own education, broken down by age groups. The data is presented as a horizontal bar graph.
The key findings are:
1. All adults: 15%
2. Ages 18-29: 34%
3. Ages 30-44: 22%
4. Ages 45-59: 7%
5. Ages 60+: 1%
The title of the chart states "About one-third of those ages 18 to 29 currently have student loan debt," which is supported by the 34% figure for that age group.
The source of the data is cited as "Pew Research Center analysis of Federal Reserve Board's 2018 Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking."
The chart effectively illustrates how student loan debt is most prevalent among younger adults and decreases significantly with age.
