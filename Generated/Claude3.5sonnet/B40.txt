This chart displays the relationship between the number of internet-connected devices a person owns and their likelihood of using Twitter or another service to update their status.
The chart shows:
1. One device: 10% of users tweet
2. Two devices: 19% of users tweet
3. Three devices: 28% of users tweet
4. Four or more devices: 39% of users tweet
The vertical axis represents the percentage of internet users, while the horizontal axis shows the number of devices owned.
The data is presented in a bar chart format, with dark blue bars representing the percentage for each category.
The title of the chart is "More devices, more likely to tweet", which summarizes the main finding of the data.
At the bottom, there's a note about the source of the data: It's from a Pew Internet & American Life Project survey conducted from August 18-September 14, 2009. The sample size was 1,698 internet users, and there's a mention of a margin of error of +/-5% based on subgroup.
The chart is branded with the Pew Internet logo at the bottom right corner.
