This chart is a pie graph showing Americans' opinions on spending for policing in their area. The data comes from a survey conducted by Pew Research Center from June 16-22, 2020.
The chart breaks down responses into five categories:
1. "Stay about the same" - 42%
2. "Increased a lot" - 11%
3. "Increased a little" - 20%
4. "Decreased a little" - 14%
5. "Decreased a lot" - 12%
The chart also groups these responses into broader categories:
- "Increased" (combining "a lot" and "a little") - 31%
- "Decreased" (combining "a lot" and "a little") - 25%
The title of the chart emphasizes that more Americans favor keeping spending the same or increasing it, compared to those who favor cutting spending.
The chart notes that "No answer" responses are not shown in the data presented.
This visualization effectively shows the distribution of opinions on police spending, with the largest segment supporting maintaining current spending levels.
