This chart shows the average interest rate on U.S. public debt from 1988 to 2018, measured at the end of each fiscal year (September 30). The graph illustrates a general downward trend in interest rates over this 30-year period.
Key points from the chart:
1. The interest rate starts at a high of 8.8% in 1988.
2. There's a sharp decline in rates from 1988 to the mid-1990s.
3. The rate continues to decline more gradually through the 2000s.
4. The lowest point on the chart is 2.5% in 2018.
5. The title suggests that rates are "now heading higher" after reaching this historic low.
The y-axis shows interest rates from 0% to 10%, while the x-axis spans from 1988 to 2018 in 4-year intervals.
The chart also includes notes explaining that these rates are calculated on total unmatured interest-bearing debt, excluding inflation-protected securities. It mentions that debt figures before 2001 exclude a small amount of non-interest-bearing debt.
