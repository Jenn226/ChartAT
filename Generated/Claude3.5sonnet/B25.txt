This chart presents data on the online social climate, specifically addressing how internet users perceive the kindness of people they encounter online. The data is from a Pew Research Center Internet Project Survey conducted in January 2014.
The chart shows three categories of responses:
1. "Mostly kind" - 76% of respondents
2. "Mostly unkind" - 13% of respondents
3. "Both equally" - 6% of respondents
The y-axis represents the percentage of internet users, ranging from 0 to 100%, while the x-axis shows the response categories.
The data is presented as a bar graph, with the "Mostly kind" category having the tallest bar at 76%, followed by "Mostly unkind" at 13%, and "Both equally" at 6%.
The title of the chart is "The online social climate: Mostly kind" which reflects the dominant finding that a large majority of respondents find people online to be mostly kind.
At the bottom, the chart cites the source of the data and indicates that the sample size was 857 internet users.
