This chart shows the percentage of people who own a game console like an Xbox or PlayStation, broken down by generation/age group. Here are the specific percentages for each group:
1. Millennials (18-34): 63%
2. Gen X (35-46): 63%
3. Younger Boomers (47-56): 38%
4. Older Boomers (57-65): 19%
5. Silent Gen. (66-74): 8%
6. G.I. Gen. (75+): 3%
7. All adults (18+): 42%
The data comes from a Pew Research Center survey conducted in August-September 2010, with a sample size of 3,001 adults aged 18 and older. The survey was conducted in English and Spanish, with 2,804 responses in English and 197 in Spanish.
The chart clearly shows that younger generations (Millennials and Gen X) have the highest rates of game console ownership, while ownership rates decline significantly with each older generation.
