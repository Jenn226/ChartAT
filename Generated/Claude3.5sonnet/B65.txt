This chart shows statistics on the prevalence of depression among American teens aged 12-17 in 2017. It presents the percentage of teens who have experienced at least one major depressive episode in the past year, broken down by gender.
The data shows:
- Overall, 13% of teens experienced a major depressive episode.
- For girls, the rate was 20%.
- For boys, the rate was 7%.
The title highlights that teen girls are three times as likely as boys to experience depression, which is supported by the data (20% vs 7%).
The chart also includes a note explaining that "major depressive episode" is defined according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, and is used as a proxy measure for depression.
