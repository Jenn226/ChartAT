The bar graph shows that majority (60%) of black Americans prefer to get news from television, while only about half as many white adults (43%) and Hispanic adults (45%) say they do so. The data is sourced from PEW Research Center's survey conducted in July-August 2018 among U.S. adults who were not Hispanic. Respondents who chose other mediums such as "News websites/apps," "social media," "print" or "radio" for getting their news weren't included here. It should be noted that whites and blacks include only those who are non-Hispanic; Hispanics can belong to any race group.
