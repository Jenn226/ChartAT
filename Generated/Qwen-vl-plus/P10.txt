The pie chart presents data on whether Democratic-leaning independents would like to see other Democratic candidates challenge Barack Obama for his party's nomination in the upcoming presidential election, which is scheduled for 2012. The majority (59%) do not want any challenges from within their own party against President Obama at that time.
A smaller portion (32%) supports seeing other Democratic candidates challenging him, while only about one-tenth (9%) express uncertainty or "don't know" regarding this issue. This information provides insight into the political sentiment among these individuals and can be used as an indicator of potential support base for alternative candidates should they emerge during the primary process leading up to the general elections.
