The bar graph shows that, based on their online experiences, most internet users (76%) say people they have witnessed or encountered on the Internet are mostly kind to each other. Only about one in seven respondents said people were "mostly unkind" and less than two percent thought both equally so. The data is from Pew Research Center's January 9-12, 2014 survey among N=857 internet users.
