The graph shows that from 1970 to 2019, the U.S Hispanic population has been increasing steadily and reached nearly 61 million in 2019. The data is presented as millions with dots representing each year's estimate and an upward sloping line connecting them. There is also a note explaining that population estimates for 1990-2019 were based on July 1st figures every year. Additionally, Hispanics refer to people of any race. Finally, there's information about where this analysis was conducted by Pew Research Center using decennial censuses between 1970-1980, intercensus population estimates for 1990-1999 and 2000-2009, and Vintage 2019 estimates provided by US Census Bureau.
