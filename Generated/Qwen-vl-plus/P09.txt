The pie graph shows that two-thirds (67%) of Hispanic adults say being Hispanic is part of their racial background, while about half (56%) consider it to be both racial and ethnic background. Additionally, one-fifth (20%) see themselves as having an ethnic background only, with another fifth (also 20%) not knowing or refusing to answer how they identify in this regard. The data presented here comes from the Survey of U.S. Multiracial Adults conducted between February 6th-April 6th, 2015 by PEW Research Center. Please note that due to rounding errors, figures may not add up exactly to 100%.
