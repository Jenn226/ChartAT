The graph shows that Europe's unauthorized immigrant population reached its peak in 2016, and then leveled off to around 4.8 million people by 2017. The estimates for this number vary between low estimate (3.9 million) and high estimate (4.8 million). This data is based on Pew Research Center estimates using Eurostat and European labor force survey information from all EU countries as well as four EFTA states - Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland. It should be noted that these numbers include asylum seekers waiting for their case decisions.
