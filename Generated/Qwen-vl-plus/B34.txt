The image presents a bar graph titled "Video watching outranks many online activities". The x-axis represents different types of internet usage, while the y-axis indicates the percentage of internet users who have engaged in each activity.
There are four bars on this graph:
- A tall blue bar labeled as "Watch video on sharing site (April 09)", representing that 62% of internet users had watched videos on such sites.
- Another medium-sized blue bar labeled as "Use social networking site (April 09)" with 46%, indicating that around half of all internet users used these platforms during April 2009.
- A shorter blue bar labeled as "Download a podcast (May 08)" shows only 19%. This suggests that downloading podcasts was not very popular among internet users at that time.
- Lastly, there's another short blue bar for "Use Twitter / share updates (April 09)". It stands out to be just above 10%.
At the bottom right corner of the graphic is the source information which reads "Pew Internet & American Life Project survey conducted from March 26-April 29, 2009."
This data provides an insight into how people were using their internet connections back then and highlights the popularity of video streaming compared to other forms of digital engagement.
