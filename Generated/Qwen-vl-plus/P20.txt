The pie chart shows that one-quarter (27%) of seniors use online social networks, while another quarter do not go online at all and only access information through offline means or other people's sharing. The remaining half is divided between those who go online but don't have SNS accounts (32%), which includes email users, internet news readers, etc., and those with both online presence and SNS account usage (41%). This data was collected from Pew Research Centerâ€™s Internet Project tracking survey conducted in July-September 2013.
