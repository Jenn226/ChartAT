The graph is titled "Tablet ownership over time (2010-2013)". It shows the percentage of American adults aged 18 and above who own a tablet computer, from May 2010 to May 2013. The x-axis represents years while the y-axis indicates percentages.
Starting with only about 4% in May 2010, this figure gradually increases until it reaches almost half by September 2011. After that point, there's an initial decrease before another steady increase leading up to around 35% in April-May 2013.
A note at the bottom states that these data come from Pew Research Centerâ€™s Internet & American Life Project tracking surveys conducted between May 2010 and May 2013. The sample size for each survey was approximately 2,252 adults ages 18 or older, and their margin of error on the sample is +/- 2.3%.
