The graph shows that from 1940 to 2018, births per thousand females ages 15-19 in the United States have decreased dramatically over time. The rate was around 63.7 in 1940 and dropped sharply during the baby boom years (from about 1946 to 1964) before rising slightly again until reaching its peak at nearly 96.3 in 1957. After this point, it began declining steadily, falling below 60 for the first time in 1970 and dropping further to just above 40 by the turn of the century. By 2018, it had fallen even lower - down to only 17.4 births per thousand female teenagers aged between fifteen and nineteen across all states combined. This represents an overall decrease of more than half since its highest level recorded back then!
