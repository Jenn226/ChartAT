The graph shows that cost savings and helping the environment were the top two reasons people consider solar at home, with percentages of homeowners who say each is a reason they have installed or would install solar panels at home being 96% and 87%, respectively. The other two reasons include getting a tax credit (67%) and better health for oneself/family members (60%). It's important to note that those saying "not a reason" and not giving an answer are excluded from this data presentation. This information was based on survey responses collected between October 1st and 13th in 2019 by Pew Research Center.
