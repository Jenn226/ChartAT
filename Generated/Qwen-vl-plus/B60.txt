The image presents a vertical bar graph that compares the percentage distribution of newsroom employees in three age groups between two different years, specifically from 2008 to 2018.
On the y-axis, we can see percentages ranging from zero to fifty percent with increments of ten percent. The x-axis displays the categories for each year and their corresponding ages - "Ages 55+", "35-54", and "18-34".
In 2008, there were approximately equal numbers of newsroom workers across all age groups. Specifically:
- For those aged 55 or older (the top category), about 15% of full-time U.S. newsroom employees fell into this group.
- In contrast, around 48% of these workers were within the 35 to 54-year-old range.
- Lastly, roughly 37% of them were under the age of 34.
By comparing these figures to data collected in 2018, it's evident that the share of younger newsroom staff has increased significantly over time while the proportion among middle-aged professionals decreased correspondingly.
For instance, only 25% of the workforce was made up by individuals aged 55+ in 2018 compared to 15% in 2008. On the other hand, the portion of people working in newsrooms who fall into the 35 to 54-years bracket dropped from 48% down to just 36%. Meanwhile, the number of young journalists rose slightly from 39% in 2008 to 39% in 2018.
This graphical representation provides an insightful snapshot of how the demographics of newsroom personnel have changed during the past decade. It highlights significant shifts towards a more youthful composition, possibly reflecting changes in industry trends or generational preferences.
