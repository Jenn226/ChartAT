Category 1 (66%): This category represents internet users who utilize only one type of payment method.
Category 2 (24%): The second group consists of individuals using two distinct payment methods.
Category 3 (11%): Lastly, there is a smaller percentage of people who employ multiple payment options or have access to at least three unique ways to pay online.
