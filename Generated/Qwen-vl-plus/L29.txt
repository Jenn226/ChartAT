The graph shows that the percentage of foreign-born population in U.S. has been increasing since 2007, reaching its highest level at about 13% by 2018. The line graph also indicates two significant dips around 1940 and 1965-1970 when it was below 10%. It is worth noting that there were no data available for some years between 1850 to 1960 due to changes in census questions or survey methods. Additionally, an arrow points out "1965" as this year marks the passage of Immigration and Nationality Act which led to increased immigration into United States after World War II era restrictions had been lifted.
