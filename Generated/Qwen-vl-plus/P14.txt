The pie chart is divided into two sections, representing internet users and non-internet users among adults without health insurance. The majority (79%) of these individuals use the internet, while only about one-fifth (21%) do not have access to or utilize it. This data was collected from interviews conducted in English and Spanish on both landline phones and cellphones between August 7th and September 6th, 2012 by Pew Research Center's Internet & American Life Project Health Survey. It should be noted that there may be an error margin for results based on those who don't have health insurance, which could range up to +/-5.6 percentage points.
