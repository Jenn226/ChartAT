The image presents a bar graph titled "India's Greatest National Threat" and is accompanied by a subtitle "% of Indians who say". The x-axis represents different threats, while the y-axis indicates their corresponding percentages.
There are six bars in total, each representing one threat:
- Pakistan occupies the largest portion with its bar stretching from about 40% to almost 50%. This suggests that it is considered as India's greatest national threat.
- Lashkar-e-Taiba follows closely behind with its bar spanning roughly from 20% to just over 30%.
- Naxalites have less influence on public opinion, represented by a smaller bar situated around 16%.
- China has the least perceived impact among these four threats, indicated by an even shorter bar at approximately 5%.
- All/None of the above option receives support from only three percent of respondents, suggesting this category might be seen as insignificant or not applicable for some people.
Lastly, there's another group labeled 'Don't know/Refused' which accounts for nearly 20%, indicating uncertainty or refusal to answer regarding the question posed.
Overall, the data presented here provides insights into how Indian citizens perceive various security concerns affecting their nation.
