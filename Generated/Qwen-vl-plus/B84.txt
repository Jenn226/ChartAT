The bar graph shows that among parents ages 18 to 49 who cite reasons other than just not wanting more children for why they're unlikely to have more kids, medical reasons is cited by 41% as the top reason, followed by age at 25%. The next most common reasons given were already having kids (9%), financial reasons (6%) and no willing partner (3%). Some other reason was also mentioned by 6% of respondents. It's important to note that this survey did allow participants to mention up to three different reasons, so some individuals may fall into multiple categories. Additionally, those who didn't offer an answer weren't included in these figures. This data comes from a Pew Research Center survey conducted between July 30-August 12, 2018.
