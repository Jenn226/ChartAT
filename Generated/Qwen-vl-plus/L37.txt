The graph shows that as of 2018, half (53%) of immigrants in U.S. were English proficient. This is down from its peak at 57% in 1980 and has been generally declining since then until it hit an all-time low of 48% in 2010 before recovering slightly to 53%. The data points on this line graph represent percentages of foreign-born population ages five or older who speak only English at home or can communicate very well with others using English if they do not use English exclusively at home.
