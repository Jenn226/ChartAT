The pie graph shows that most people believe ordinary Americans' actions affect how COVID-19 spreads in the U.S., with about two-thirds (59%) saying it affects "a great deal." Only one-in-four say this has not affected at all or only slightly, and ten percent think it's had some effect but not too much. The data is based on surveys conducted from June 16 to 22, 2020 among American adults by PEW Research Center. No answer responses were excluded from these results.
