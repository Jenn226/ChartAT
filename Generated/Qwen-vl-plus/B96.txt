The graph is a bar chart that shows the percentage of U.S parents who say their child ever watches videos on YouTube, categorized by age group and total number. The x-axis lists four categories - Total (all children), Age of Child 0-2 years old, Children aged between 3 to 4 years old, and Children aged from 5 to 11 years old. Each category has its own blue-colored vertical bar with different lengths indicating the corresponding percentages listed above each bar in white text. For example, for "Total", it's shown as 80%, while for "Age of Child 0-2" it's displayed at 57%. At the bottom left corner of the image there's an information note explaining how multiple-child families were asked about one particular child when answering this question. Additionally, non-responsive parent answers weren't included in the data presented here. This was sourced from PEW Research Center's survey conducted March 2nd through 15th, 2020 under the theme 'Parenting Children in the Age of Screens'.
