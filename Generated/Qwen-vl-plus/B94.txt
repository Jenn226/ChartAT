The bar graph shows that most people believe elected officials using heated or aggressive language to talk about certain groups makes violence against those groups more likely, with Democrats being significantly more likely than Republicans to hold this view. The majority (78%) of all respondents agree with this statement, while only around half (52%) of Republican leaners and Democratic leaners do not share this belief. This suggests there is a significant partisan divide on this issue in the United States.
