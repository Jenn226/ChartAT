The pie chart shows that there were about 45.6 million foreign-born people living in the U.S., including both unauthorized immigrants and legal ones, as of 2017. Among them, naturalized citizens made up approximately one-fourth (or 23%) of this population; lawful permanent residents accounted for nearly one-third (or 27%); temporary lawful residents represented less than five percent (or 5%).
