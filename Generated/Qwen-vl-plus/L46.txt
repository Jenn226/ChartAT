The graph shows that more voters believe it really matters who wins the presidency than at any point in the last twenty years, with this percentage increasing from around 50% to over 83%. In contrast, fewer people think things will be pretty much the same regardless of who is elected, dropping from about 44% down to less than 20%. The data comes from telephone surveys conducted by PEW Research Center between July 23 and August 4, 2020 among registered U.S. adults.
