The chart shows that there has been an increase in support for prioritizing policies on protecting the environment and dealing with global climate change since 2011, as measured by percentage of U.S. adults who say these issues should be a top priority for the president and Congress. The line graph displays this trend over time, showing how attitudes have shifted from around 40% to nearly 65% for environmental protection and slightly above 30% to just under 50% for addressing global climate change. This data is sourced from surveys conducted annually between January 8-13th starting in 2008 until present day (as indicated at bottom). It's important to note that some years had different questions asked about "global warming" versus "climate change", which may affect interpretation of results.
