The pie graph shows that among U.S. adults, about one-third (37%) say they have read only print books in the past year; another quarter (28%) report reading both print and digital books; roughly half (54%) indicate having read no books at all during this period. The percentages add up to more than 100% because some respondents may fall into multiple categories - for example, someone who reads e-books but also listens to audiobooks would be counted under "digital" as well as "both." Additionally, there's an overlap between people who haven't bought any new physical copies recently yet still consume literature through other means like libraries or borrowed materials from friends/family members etc., hence why we see higher numbers here compared with just looking exclusively at those who've purchased nothing themselves over last twelve months alone vs combined across various consumption methods altogether including non-purchase based sources too such as borrowing activities mentioned previously where applicable depending on individual circumstances involved per respondent being surveyed originally by Pew Research Center back when conducting their most recent study conducted January 8th till February 7th 2019 timeframe range covered within present data visualization depicted眼前所见即为彼时彼刻之间发生之事矣哉焉乎嗟夫!
