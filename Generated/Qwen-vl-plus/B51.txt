The image presents a bar graph titled "Reported anti-Semitic acts in France, by year". The x-axis represents years from 2011 to 2018, while the y-axis indicates the number of reported incidents against Jews and Jewish property.
Starting with the leftmost point on the x-axis (representing 2011), there were 389 such incidents recorded. Moving rightwards along the axis, we see that this figure increased steadily until it reached its peak at around the middle of the timeline - specifically, for the year 2014 when an alarming total of 851 incidents was documented.
From here, however, the trend reverses itself as the numbers start declining again. By the end of our time frame, i.e., the year 2018, only 541 incidents had been reported, which is significantly lower than what occurred during previous years.
It's important to note that these figures include both physical attacks on individuals and damage done to their properties due to prejudice or hatred towards them based on their ethnicity or religion. This data has been sourced from two reputable institutions - Commission Nationale Consultative des Droits de l'Homme (CNCDH) and Ministère de l’Intérieur, France.
