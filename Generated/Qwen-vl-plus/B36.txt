The bar graph represents data on access to high-speed internet at home or work from September to December in 2005, categorized into three groups - rural, urban and suburban.
In this particular case, there is no clear distinction between 'home' and 'work', as both categories have been combined for analysis purposes. The y-axis displays the number of people accessing high-speed internet while the x-axis shows different regions (rural, urban, and suburban).
Accordingly:
- In the "Rural" category, approximately 35 individuals had access.
- For the "Urban" group, around 49 residents were connected with high-speed internet services.
- Similarly, about 49 inhabitants living in the "Suburban" region also enjoyed such connectivity benefits during that period.
This information can be useful when analyzing trends related to internet usage across various geographical locations within a given time frame. It provides insights into how many people in each area could potentially benefit from having fast internet connections available either at their homes or workplaces.
