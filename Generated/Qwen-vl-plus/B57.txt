The image presents a bar graph that illustrates the percentage of digital-native news outlets in the United States which experienced layoffs between 2017 and 2018, as reported by Pew Research Center's analysis of digital news stories about layoffs at these outlets.
In 2017, approximately 20% (represented by a dark brown column) of such news outlets were affected by layoffs. This figure remained relatively constant for 2018 with around 14% (indicated by an orange column). The y-axis represents percentages while the x-axis shows two distinct years - 2017 on one end and 2018 on another. A legend is also present to clarify the color coding used for each year.
