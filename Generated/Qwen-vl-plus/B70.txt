The image presents a bar graph that compares the percentage change in employment from 1980 to 2018 across different types of jobs, categorized by their most important skills. The x-axis lists five skill categories - Social, Fundamental, Analytical, Managerial and Mechanical - while the y-axis represents the corresponding percentage increase or decrease in job numbers.
Accordingly, there's an additional text at the top left corner indicating "Employment is rising most rapidly in occupations where social and fundamental skills are most important".
In terms of data points, for all jobs combined (denoted as All Jobs), we see a growth rate of approximately 58%. However, when it comes to jobs requiring certain key skills, some show significant increases compared with others:
- For those demanding 'Social' skills, the number has increased by over three times more than average.
- Similarly, jobs needing 'Fundamental' abilities have seen nearly double the overall growth rate.
- On the other hand, positions reliant on 'Analytical', 'Managerial', and 'Mechanical' competencies experienced less pronounced gains relative to total employment figures.
This comparison suggests that employers might be prioritizing roles which require strong interpersonal and foundational proficiencies during this period.
