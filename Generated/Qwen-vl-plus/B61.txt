The image is a bar graph titled "In 2017, nearly one-in-five commissioned officers in U.S. military were women". The x-axis represents years from 1975 to 2017 and the y-axis shows percentages ranging from zero to twenty percent with increments of five percentage points.
There are two sets of bars on this graph - one set for enlisted personnel (yellow) and another for commissioned officers (green).
For enlisted personnel:
- In 1975, only about 5% of all enlisted personnel were female.
- This number increased slightly over time but remained relatively stable until reaching its peak at around 14% by 2005 before decreasing back down to approximately 13% in both 1985 and 1995.
- By 2017, there was an increase again up to almost 16%.
For commissioned officers:
- Similarly, just under 5% of commissionedservice members were women in 1975.
- There wasn't much change between then and now; however, it's worth noting that while more than double today compared to what we saw earlier – roughly 18% as opposed to less than half that amount previously – these figures still represent quite small proportions when considering overall numbers involved here given how many people typically serve within each branch separately let alone across them collectively worldwide!
Overall trends suggest progress has been made towards greater gender equality among those serving their country through active duty service although further improvements could certainly be achieved especially regarding representation levels amongst higher ranks where traditionally males have dominated roles such as leadership positions etcetera...
