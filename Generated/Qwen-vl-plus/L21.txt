The image presents a line graph titled "Interest rates on U.S. public debt, once at historic low, now heading higher". The x-axis represents years from '88 to '18 with labels for each decade ('96, '04 and so forth). The y-axis is labeled as "Average interest rate on public debt" ranging from zero percent up to ten percent in increments of one percentage point.
Starting from an average interest rate of around eight percent in fiscal year end (Sept.30) of 1988, it rapidly drops down to about two percent by fiscal year end (Sept.30) of 2018. This decline can be seen clearly through the blue trendline that dips sharply downwards during this period.
A note below the graph clarifies that these figures represent the total unmatured interest-bearing debt excluding inflation-protected securities. It also mentions that before 2001, there was some non-interest-bearing debt excluded from the calculations.
