The image presents a bar graph titled "More devices, more likely to tweet". The x-axis represents different numbers of internet-connected devices (from one device up to four or more), while the y-axis indicates the percentage of internet users who use Twitter.
Accordingly, for individuals owning only one internet-connected device, approximately 10% utilize Twitter as their means of updating status online. This figure increases slightly with each additional connected device; when two devices are owned by an individual, about 28% report using Twitter, and this number rises further to around 39% among those possessing three or more internet-connected devices.
This trend suggests that there is a positive correlation between the quantity of internet-connected devices someone owns and their likelihood of utilizing social media platforms like Twitter. However, it's important to note these percentages represent estimates based on data from August 18-September 14, 2009, collected through Pew Internet & American Life Project surveys.
