The bar graph shows data on the percentage distribution of U.S. poll workers in different age groups during the 2018 general election. The majority (47%) were aged between 61 and 70, followed by those aged over 71 years old at 35%. On the other hand, only about one-fifth of the poll workers fell into two younger categories - ages under 26 or from 26 to 40. This suggests that older individuals tend to be more involved as poll workers compared to their younger counterparts. It's important to note this could vary based on jurisdiction reporting policies for poll worker age information.
