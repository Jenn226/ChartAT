The bar graph shows percentages of U.S. adults who think that the federal government is doing too little to protect water quality, air quality, reduce effects of global climate change, protect animals and their habitats, or protect open lands in national parks and nature preserves. The majority (68%) say it's not doing enough about protecting water quality; slightly fewer (67%) feel this way about reducing greenhouse gas emissions; while roughly two-thirds also believe the same for protecting air quality (67%), animals and their habitats (62%). However, only half (55%) hold similar views on preserving open land spaces within protected areas.
