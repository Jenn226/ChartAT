The image presents a bar graph titled "Technologies that would be very hard to give up". The x-axis represents various technologies, including internet, cell phone, television, email, landline telephone and social media. Each technology is represented by a vertical blue bar with its corresponding percentage on top.
On the y-axis, which ranges from zero to sixty percent, we can see how many adults out of all respondents say these technologies would be 'very hard or impossible' for them to give up.
For instance, about forty-six percent of all adults find it difficult to imagine life without the Internet, while thirty-five percent feel similarly towards their cell phones. Television comes in third place at thirty-four percent, followed closely by email (thirty-one percent) and then landlines (seventeen percent). Interestingly, only ten percent of those surveyed consider giving up social media as challenging.
This data was collected through the Pew Research Center's January survey where they asked N=1006 adults about this topic. The source information is clearly stated at the bottom right corner of the graphic.
