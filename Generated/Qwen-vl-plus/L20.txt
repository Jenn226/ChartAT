The graph shows that world population is expected to grow from about 2.5 billion in 1950, reaching its peak at around 7.8 billion by mid-century and then declining slightly over time until it reaches approximately 10.9 billion people by year 2100. The data labels for years 1950, 2000, and 2100 show these values on the x-axis. This indicates an overall increase in global population before leveling off towards the end of this century.
