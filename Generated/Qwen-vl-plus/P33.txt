The pie chart shows that most U.S. adults believe climate change is affecting their local community at least some, with about two-thirds (62%) saying this and only one-third (38%) believing it's not too much or not at all. The data comes from an October survey conducted by PEW Research Center on public views regarding climate and energy issues in the United States.
