The graph is titled "Percent of Americans with Home Broadband Connections" and it shows how many percent of American households had home broadband connections from year to year, starting in 2000 until 2007. The y-axis represents percentages ranging from zero (at bottom) up to fifty percent at top. The x-axis spans years from 2000 on left side through 2007 on right side.
Starting around 24% in early 2000s, this percentage steadily increases over time reaching almost half or about 47% by end of 2007 decade. This suggests that there was significant growth in adoption rate for home broadband services during these years.
It's important to note that while the data provided here gives us an overall trend, individual years might have seen fluctuations due to various factors such as economic conditions, technological advancements, government policies etc., which could impact consumer behavior towards adopting new technologies like internet connectivity. However, based solely upon this information we can confidently say that more than one-fourth i.e., approximately 25%-30%, of US population started using high-speed Internet access service within their homes between 2000-2007 period.
