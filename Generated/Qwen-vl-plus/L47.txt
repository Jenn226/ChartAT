The graph shows that from 2005 to 2020, Americans' unfavorable views on China have been increasing steadily while their favorable opinions have remained relatively stable and low. In particular, in 2020, the percentage of people with an unfavorable view of China reached its highest point at 66%, compared to only 26% who had a favorable opinion. This suggests that there is growing negative sentiment towards China among American public opinion.
