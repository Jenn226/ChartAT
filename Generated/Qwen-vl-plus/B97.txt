The bar graph shows that before recent tensions, many Indians expressed concern about Pakistan and terrorism. Specifically, around 76% of them believed that "Pakistan is a very serious threat to our country," while approximately 58% thought that "Indian government should use more military force in Kashmir." Additionally, roughly half (49%) agreed with the statement "Terrorism is a very big problem" for India. The other two statements were less popular among respondents; only slightly over one-third considered both "Kashmir as a very big problem" and "the situation has gotten worse over the past five years".
