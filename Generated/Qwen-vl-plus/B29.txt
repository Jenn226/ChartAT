The image presents a bar graph titled "Adults Currently Married" and is accompanied by two notes at its bottom. The x-axis represents years, ranging from 1920 to 2012 in increments of five years. On the y-axis, values range from zero percent up to seventy-five percent.
Each year's data point on this vertical axis corresponds with a green-colored bar that spans horizontally across the width of the graph. These bars represent the percentage of adults aged 18 or older who were currently married during each specified time period.
Two notes accompany the graph. One explains that those reporting as 'separated' aren't included within the category of 'currently married'. This suggests that only individuals who identified themselves as being legally married (either living together or apart) were counted towards these statistics.
The second note provides additional context about how the data was derived - it states that the information comes from tabulations made using both the Decennial Census data for the years between 1920-2000 and the American Community Survey Integrated Public Use Microdata Sample (ACS IPUMS), which covers the period from 2006-2012.
This detailed description aims to provide an accurate representation of what can be observed visually in the given chart. It emphasizes the importance of understanding not just the numbers but also their sources when interpreting such statistical representations.
