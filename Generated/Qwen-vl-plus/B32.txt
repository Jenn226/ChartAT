The bar graph presents data on e-book device ownership among different age groups and all adults in English (n=2,804) and Spanish (n=197). The x-axis represents various age categories including Millennials (18-34), Gen Xers (35-46), Younger Boomers (47-56), Older Boomers (57-65), Silent Generation (66-74), G.I. Generation (75+), and All Adults (18+).
Each category is represented by a vertical column with varying shades of blue or gray depending on whether it's an English-speaking group or not.
For example:
- "Millennials" has two columns - one for English speakers which is dark blue and another for non-English speakers that is light gray.
- Similarly, there are other columns representing each generation in both languages.
This visual representation allows us to compare how many people from these generations own electronic book devices across both language demographics. It also provides insights into any potential differences between those who speak English as their primary language versus those who do not.
