The bar graph shows that among U.S. adults who say following the news is very important to being a good citizen, 55% correctly identified whether three or more of six sources do original news reporting; while those who consider it somewhat important have a rate at 44%; and for those not too/at all important, this figure stands at 32%. The data was collected through surveys conducted on June 2-11, 2020 by PEW Research Center. Note that some respondents did not provide an answer when asked about their identification abilities regarding original news reports from these media outlets.
