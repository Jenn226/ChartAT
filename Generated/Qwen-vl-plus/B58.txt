The graph shows that most Democrats with high science knowledge believe human activity contributes greatly to climate change, but there is no parallel among Republicans. The percentage of Republicans or Democrats who say human activity contributes significantly to global climate change varies depending on their level of scientific knowledge. For example, only about one-fifth (25%) of low-knowledge Republicans and less than half (41%) of medium-knowledge Republicans agree that humans play an important role in causing climate change. In contrast, nearly nine-tenths (89%) of highly knowledgeable Democrats think so. This suggests that political affiliation plays a significant role in shaping attitudes towards climate change, even when individuals have strong scientific backgrounds.
