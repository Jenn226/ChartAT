The bar graph presents data on cell phone ownership among different age groups and generations in English-speaking adults, as well as Spanish-speaking adults (not specified by generation). The x-axis represents various demographic categories such as "Millennials" (ages 18-34), "Gen X" (ages 35-46), "Younger Boomers" (ages 47-56), "Older Boomers" (ages 57-65), "Silent Gen." (ages 66-74) or Generation Y (ages 75+).
Each category is represented by a vertical blue bar with varying heights indicating the percentage of individuals who own a cell phone within that group.
Additionally, there's an extra gray bar for all adult population aged 18+. This bar spans across multiple ages but does not specify any particular generational cohort.
A note at the bottom indicates that interviews were conducted via internet tracking surveys between August 9th to September 13th, 2010. A total sample size was N=3,001 adults aged 18 years old and above, including 1,000 reached through cellular telephones. Interviews took place both in English and Spanish languages; however, no further details about these two language-specific samples have been provided.
