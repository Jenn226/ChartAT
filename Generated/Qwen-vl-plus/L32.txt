The graph shows Puerto Rico's population from 1950 to 2018, measured in millions. The line starts at around 3 million people and gradually decreases until it hits its lowest point after Hurricane Maria and Irma struck in September 2017. It then rises slightly but remains below previous levels before stabilizing near 3.2 million by 2018. A note on the bottom explains that these estimates were made using data collected between July 1st for each year up through 2018. Source information is also provided as "Pew Research Center analysis of U.S Census Bureau intercensal estimates for 1950-2009" with vintage 2018 estimates used for years following this date (i.e., 2010 - present). Finally, there's an arrow pointing towards text which reads 'Hurricanes Maria & Irma Struck Puerto Rico In Sept.' This suggests some correlation or causality between those events and subsequent changes observed within our dataset.
