The graph shows that ICE arrests have increased after Trump took office, but remain lower than during much of Obama's tenure. The number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests is shown by fiscal year from '09 to '19. In '09 there were 297,898 arrests, which decreased sharply in '13 to around 110,104, then rose slightly again in '15 before dropping off significantly in '17 to about 143,099. There was another slight increase in '19 back up to almost 160,000. Notes indicate this includes only administrative arrests made by ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations. It does not include apprehensions made by Customs and Border Protection. Source information indicates it comes from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement at PEW Research Center.
