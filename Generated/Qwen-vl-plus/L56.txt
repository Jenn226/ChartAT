The image presents a line graph titled "British views of the EU reached a historic high". The x-axis represents years from 2004 to 2020, while the y-axis indicates percentages ranging from 36% to 60%.
There are two lines on this graph representing British opinions towards the European Union (EU). One is labeled as 'Favorable', and it starts at around 54%, then gradually increases until reaching its peak in June 2016 with about 60%. After that point, there's a slight decrease but remains above 50%.
On the other hand, the second line marked as 'Unfavorable' shows an initial decline starting from approximately 39% down to almost 40% by mid-2018 before rising slightly again.
A note below the graph clarifies that those who did not answer were excluded from these statistics. Additionally, references to sources such as Summer 2020 Global Attitudes Survey conducted between June 10th - July 28th, 2020, Q8d., and "Majorities in the European Union Have Favorable Views of the Bloc" can be found here. These suggest credibility for data presented within the graph.
