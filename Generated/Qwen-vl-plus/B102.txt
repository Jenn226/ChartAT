The graph shows that in January, 2020, about 64% of Democratic and lean Democratic voters said their impression of candidates running for the Democratic nomination was excellent or good. This is lower than what it was in January, 2008 when around 78% had this view. The percentage has also dropped from over half (53%) who felt similarly back in February, 1992 to just under one third (37%) in January, 1988. *Note that data for Jan 1988 includes all adult Democrats and Democratic leaners while other years only include registered Dem voters/leaners.
