The graph is titled "Arab-American Population in U.S." and provides data from year 2000 to 2012, with each point representing an estimate of Arab-Americans population (in millions). The x-axis represents years ranging from 2000-2012 while the y-axis shows the estimated number of people living within this demographic group.
Starting at around 1 million individuals in 2000, the line steadily increases over time until it reaches approximately 1.8 million by 2012. This suggests that there has been significant growth in the Arab-American community during these twelve years.
