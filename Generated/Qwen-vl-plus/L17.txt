The graph shows that from 2000 to 2020, the percentage of eligible voters in the United States who identify as Latino has been increasing steadily. In 2000, this figure was at about 7.4%, and by 2020 it is projected to reach almost 13%. The data points on the line represent actual values for each year, while the trendline indicates the overall upward trajectory over time. A note below the graph explains that "Eligible voters are U.S. citizens ages 18 and older. Latinos are of any race." Additionally, there's an attribution statement indicating that these findings come from the Pew Research Center analysis of American Community Survey (ACS) and Decennial Census data. Finally, the source provides information about how they arrived at their projections for 2020 based on US Census Bureau population projections.
