The pie graph shows that more Americans support keeping or increasing spending on policing than cutting it, with 42% saying they want to keep about the same amount and another 31% wanting an increase in funding for police departments. Only around one-fifth (20%) say there should be some decrease in spending. The percentages add up to less than 100%, as not all respondents answered every question.
