The pie chart shows the percentage distribution of immigrants aged five and older who speak different languages at home in the United States, as reported by themselves during the census interview. The data is presented for all respondents (English only), Spanish speakers, English-Spanish bilinguals, and those speaking other languages.
In total, there were approximately 47 million people ages 5+ living in the U.S., with about half of them being foreign-born. Among these individuals, roughly one-third spoke another language besides English at home.
Spanish was spoken most commonly among this group, accounting for nearly two-thirds of non-English-speaking immigrants. This suggests that many Latin American countries have had significant immigration to the US over time. Additionally, Chinese, Hindi, Filipino/Tagalog, French, Vietnamese, Dravidian, Arabic, and "All Other" languages also make up smaller portions of the immigrant population's linguistic diversity.
