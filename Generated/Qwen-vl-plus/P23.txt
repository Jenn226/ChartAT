The pie graph shows that about half (50%) of teachers surveyed believe digital technologies make it easier for them to shape or improve student writing, while another one-fifth (20%) think they have no impact on this process and only around one-tenth (18%) find these tools more difficult to use in improving students' written work. The remaining portion is not specified by color but can be inferred as "No Impact" since there's an equal amount of blue and white sections combined with other colors representing different categories.
