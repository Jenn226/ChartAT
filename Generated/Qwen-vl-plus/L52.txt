The image presents a line graph titled "Geosocial services over time". The x-axis represents different years, ranging from May 2011 to February 2013 and then again in May 2013. On the y-axis is labeled as percentages.
There are two lines on this graph representing data for smartphone owners and all adults respectively.
For smartphone users, there's an initial spike at around 18% usage rate in May 2011 followed by a gradual decline down to about 7% in May 2013. This suggests that while geosocial service use among smartphone owners was initially high, it has since declined slightly.
On the other hand, the trend for all adult users shows a steady decrease with no significant spikes or dips observed during these same periods. In May 2011, they were using such services at approximately 4%, which dropped further to just under 5% in Feb 2012 before rising back up slightly but still remaining below 6%. By May 2013, their usage had fallen even more to only 7%.
Both sets of data seem to indicate a general downward trend across both groups when considering how often people utilize geosocial services like Foursquare. However, the drop appears to be much steeper for those who own smartphones compared to non-smartphone owning individuals.
