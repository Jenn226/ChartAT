The image presents a bar graph titled "Many of Trump's major policies are unpopular globally". The x-axis lists six different policy areas, including increasing tariffs on imported goods from other countries (U.S.), withdrawal from international climate change agreements (U.S.), building a wall between U.S and Mexico, allowing fewer immigrants into the United States, withdrawing from Iran nuclear weapons agreement (U.S.) and negotiations with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un about his country's nuclear weapons program.
Each policy area is represented by two bars in green and blue colors. The green bars represent approval ratings for each policy while the blue ones indicate disapproval rates.
For instance, under the category 'increasing tariffs or fees on imported goods', it shows that only 68% approve this action, whereas 32% do not agree to increase taxes on imports. Similarly, regarding the issue of 'negotiations with North Korea', around half of respondents -41%- support these talks, but almost one-third- 36%- oppose them.
Overall, most of President Donald Trumpâ€™s actions have been met with low levels of public support across various global regions as per data collected during Spring 2019 Global Attitudes Survey conducted by PEW Research Center.
