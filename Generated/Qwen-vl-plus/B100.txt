The bar graph shows that among those with at least some college education, whites score higher than blacks and Hispanics on science knowledge in terms of mean number of correct answers out of eleven. The difference is more pronounced for individuals who have completed four years or more of college. For instance, white respondents scored an average of 9.3 points compared to black (5.6) and Hispanic (7.6). On the other hand, when considering only high school graduates or less educated group, the gap between these groups narrowed slightly but was still evident - white scores were around six point while black's stood at three-point two and Hispanic's at just over four.
