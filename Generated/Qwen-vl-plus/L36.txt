The graph shows that in American households, there were an average of five and three-quarters people per household back in 1790. However, this number has been declining since then until it reached two point six-three people per household by 2018. The decline is quite steep with only slight fluctuations over time. This trend suggests that on average, each household had fewer members as we moved further into the past century.
