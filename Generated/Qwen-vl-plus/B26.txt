The bar graph presents data on how much information and communication technology (ICT) is perceived to contribute towards increased productivity by different groups, using percentages as values for each category.
There are seven categories represented in this graph:
- All: This represents all respondents.
- Omnivores: These individuals consume both traditional media and digital media.
- Connectors: They actively share their knowledge with others through social networks or other channels.
- Productivity Enhancers: People who believe that ICT has significantly improved their work efficiency.
- Connected but Hassled: Those who feel overwhelmed by constant connectivity.
- Light But Satisfied: Individuals satisfied with their current level of connectedness without feeling overburdened.
- Indifferents: Respondents who don't have strong opinions about whether ICT helps them be more productive.
Each group's perception regarding the impact of ICT on productivity is depicted via vertical bars within the graph. The y-axis indicates these perceptions while the x-axis shows the various respondent segments.
