The image presents a bar graph titled "Number of PCs with One or More P2P Applications Installed". The x-axis represents time, labeled as "June" and spanning from June 2006 to June 2008. On the y-axis is the number in millions of PCs that have one or more peer-to-peer (P2P) applications installed.
There's a blue line representing global data for these installations across all years. This line starts at around 175 million installs in June 2006, rises slightly above 190 million by June 2007, then peaks at just over 200 million installs in June 2008 before dropping back down below 200 million again in subsequent months not shown on this graph.
At the bottom right corner of the graphic, there's a source citation indicating it was created by Pew Internet & American Life Project using PC Pitstop and BigChampagne Media Measurement data.
