The graph shows that only about one-third (33%) say they trust their national government to do what is right for Venezuela, according to data from surveys conducted between September and December in 2018 by Pew Research Center. The figure varies significantly across different demographic groups. For example, among those aged under 30 years old, just over a quarter (27%) express confidence; this rises slightly to around three-quarters (41%) among people aged 50 or older. In terms of education level, less than half (49%) of respondents with secondary school qualifications believe in the effectiveness of their government compared to almost two-thirds (66%) who have completed higher studies. Interestingly, there's an even greater divide when it comes to political affiliation - nearly four-fifths (79%) of PSUV supporters report having faith while only ten percent of non-supporters share similar sentiments. Finally, regarding economic conditions, more than twice as many individuals living in good circumstances (79%) feel confident towards their governing body versus those experiencing hardship (24%).
