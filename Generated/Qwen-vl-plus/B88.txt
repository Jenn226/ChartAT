The graph shows that people living closer to coastlines tend to be more likely than those who live farther inland to say climate change is affecting their local community "a great deal" or "some." Specifically, among U.S. adults overall, about half (59%) say global warming has affected their area at least somewhat; this figure rises to nearly two-thirds for those within less than 25 miles from coastline and to just over half for those between 25-300 miles away. Meanwhile only around one-third believe it's happening anywhere near them when they're located further out - beyond three hundred miles from shore line. The data was collected through surveys conducted March 27-April 9 in 2018 by PEW Research Center.
