The graph shows that since the late 2000s, the imprisonment rate in the United States has been declining. The number of prisoners per 100,000 adults aged 18 and over is shown on the y-axis (range from 331 to 670), while the years between '88 and '18 are displayed horizontally along the x-axis. There's also an additional note at the bottom explaining that sentenced prisoners refer to those who have received more than one year sentence in state or federal prison.
