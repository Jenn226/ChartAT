The pie graph shows that about seven-in-ten (69%) U.S. adults say they think the Census Bureau will be somewhat or very successful in producing an accurate population count for the country, while another one-in-five (20%) say it is not too likely to succeed and only 8% believe it won't produce any results at all. The survey was conducted from June 16th to 22nd, 2020 by PEW Research Center.
