The graph shows the removals of unauthorized immigrants from fiscal year 2000 to 2018, with data provided by the Department of Homeland Security's Yearbook of Immigration Statistics for 2018. The y-axis represents the number of people removed and ranges from zero to 500 thousand in increments of 100 thousand. The x-axis indicates each fiscal year starting from 2000 and ending at 2018.
In general, there is an upward trend over time until reaching its peak around 432,281 individuals being removed during the fiscal year 2017 before declining slightly to approximately 337,287 in 2018. This suggests that while the rate of deportations has increased overall since 2000, it may have reached recent highs between 2016-2018 but then declined somewhat in subsequent years. It should be noted this information does not account for any changes or fluctuations due to policy shifts, court decisions, etc., which could impact these figures significantly.
