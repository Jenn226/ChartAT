The graph shows that since 1990, the total size of U.S. active duty force has decreased from about 2 million to around 1.35 million in 2017. The number reached its peak at approximately 2 million after the Gulf War and then began declining until it dropped sharply following the 9/11 terrorist attack. Since then, there's been some fluctuation but overall numbers have remained relatively stable with slight decreases over time.
