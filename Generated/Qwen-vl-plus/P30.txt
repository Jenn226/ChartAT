The pie chart shows that, among Palestinians surveyed in March and April 2013 by the Pew Research Center, about half (45%) say armed struggle is the best way to achieve statehood for their people, while another one-fifth (22%) favor both violent and nonviolent resistance combined. Another fifth (22%) prefer negotiations with Israel or other international parties as the most effective path toward achieving Palestinian independence. A smaller share (8%) says they don’t know which approach would be best, but even this group tends to lean more towards support for armed struggle than any other option presented. The remaining 6% choose DK – presumably standing for “don't care” or some similar sentiment. This data was collected from interviews conducted across all regions where there were significant numbers of Palestinians living at the time; however, it should not necessarily reflect current opinions given how quickly political situations can change over short periods of time.
