The image presents a bar graph titled "Personal Freedoms" that explores whether or not the government in Iran respects its people's personal freedoms. The x-axis represents different countries, while the y-axis indicates percentages.
There is an additional text at the top left corner asking if the government of Iran respects the personal freedom of its people and another one on the bottom right saying 'PEW RESEARCH CENTER Q127a'.
Two bars represent two categories - Yes (green) and No (dark green). According to this data from all 39 surveyed countries in 2013, only about 6% responded with a positive answer for respect towards personal freedoms by the Iranian government. This suggests that most respondents believe the government does not respect their individual liberties.
