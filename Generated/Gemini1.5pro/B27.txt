The bar chart shows the percentage of cell phone users in different age groups who use their cell phones as a "distraction device" while watching television.
The age groups are plotted on the x-axis, ranging from 18-24 to 65+. The y-axis represents the percentage of cell phone users in each age group, ranging from 0% to 80%. 
The data shows a clear trend: younger generations are more likely to use their phones during TV breaks.

* **35-44:** 45%
* **45-54:** 27%
