The bar chart depicts the percentage of married couples with a breadwinner husband and homemaker wife across various age groups of the wife.
Here is the breakdown:
- **All Ages:**  24% of married couples fall into this category.
- **Wives aged 18-29:**  The highest percentage, at 32%, is found within this age group.
- **Wives aged 30-49:**  This group shows 27% of couples having this dynamic.
- **Wives aged 50-64:**  The percentage drops to 22% for this age group.
- **Wives aged 65 and above:**  The smallest percentage, 14%, is observed within this group.
The data suggests that the traditional breadwinner-homemaker model is most prevalent among younger couples and gradually decreases as the age of the wife increases.
