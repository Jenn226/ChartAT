The chart, made by the Pew Research Center, reveals increasing support among U.S. adults for prioritizing policies addressing the environment and climate change.
*Protecting the Environment*
 The top line, in olive green, illustrates the percentage of U.S. adults who believe protecting the environment should be a top priority for the president and Congress. Beginning at 41% in 2008, support fluctuates slightly before a significant increase starting in 2016. By 2020,  64% of U.S. adults consider environmental protection a top priority.
*Dealing with Global Climate Change*
 The lower line, in blue, shows the percentage of U.S. adults who feel that dealing with global climate change should be a top priority. Starting at 30% in 2008, support dips slightly before a noticeable upward trend emerging in 2014.  By 2020, 52% see dealing with climate change as a top priority.
**Key takeaway:** Public concern for both environmental protection and addressing climate change has risen considerably since 2011, reaching new heights by 2020.
