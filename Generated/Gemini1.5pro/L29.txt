The chart shows the percentage of the U.S. population that was foreign-born from 1850 to 2018. It highlights that this percentage is currently approaching its historical high. 
Here is a summary of the information conveyed by the chart:
* **Historical Trend:** The foreign-born share of the U.S. population peaked in 1890 at 14.8%, then declined steadily until hitting a low point of 4.7% in 1970. Since then, it has been rising steadily.
