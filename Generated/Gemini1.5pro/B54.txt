This is a bar chart from Pew Research Center that depicts the percentage of Americans in different age demographics who own an iPod or MP3 player in 2010.
* **Millenials (18-34):** 74%
* **Gen X (35-46):**  56%
* **Younger Boomers (47-56):** 42%
* **Older Boomers (57-65):** 26%
* **Silent Generation (66-74):**  16%
* **G.I. Generation (75+):** 3% 
* **All Adults (18+):** 47%
As you might expect, **ownership of MP3 players was highest among younger generations in 2010.** This is logical as this technology was newer, and likely more readily adopted by those younger.  As age increases, ownership rates decline.
