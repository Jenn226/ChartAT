The bar chart shows the percentage of adults in different age groups who own a cell phone.
The data, collected in August and September of 2010, shows that cell phone ownership is highest among Millennials (95%), closely followed by Gen X (92%) and Younger Boomers(86%).  Older Boomers come in at 84%, while 85% of all adults surveyed own cell phones.  These four groups demonstrate very similar rates of cell phone ownership, all at or above 84%. On the other hand, only 68% of the Silent Generation and 48% of the G.I. generation own cell phones.
The data comes from a Pew Research Center survey.
