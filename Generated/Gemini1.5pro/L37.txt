This line chart shows the percentage of foreign-born people ages five and older in the U.S. who were proficient in English each year from 1980 to 2018. 
Key takeaways:
* **Downward trend:**  From 1980 (57%) to 2010 (48%), there's a clear downward trend in English proficiency among immigrants.
* **Recent uptick:** After 2010, the percentage ticks slightly upward, reaching 53% in 2018.
* **Definition:**  The chart specifies that "English proficient" includes those who speak *only* English at home, as well as those who speak another language at home but indicate they can speak English "very well."
This data suggests that while the proportion of English proficient immigrants declined for a few decades, it has seen a slight increase in recent years.
