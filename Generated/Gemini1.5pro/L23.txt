* This was followed by a sharp decline to below 5% by 1970.
* Since then, there has been a steady upward trend, and the proportion of immigrants was approaching the historic high of 15% in 2017.
* The chart also highlights two key legislations passed in the US that impacted immigration to the country:  The National Origins Quota Act in 1924 and the Immigration and Nationality Act in 1965.
