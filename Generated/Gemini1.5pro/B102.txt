The chart illustrates the percentage of Democrat/Lean Democrat voters who held a positive view ("excellent or good") of candidates vying for the Democratic presidential nomination across different years. 
Here's a breakdown:
* **Jan 2008:** 78% viewed the candidates favorably - the highest recorded percentage.
* **Jan 2020:**  64% had a positive impression of the candidates. While substantial, it's lower than 2008.
* **Jan 2004:** 46% of respondents were favorable towards the candidates.
* **Feb 1992:** Positive sentiment stood at 45%.
* **Jan 1988:** The lowest recorded year with only 37% holding a positive view.
Key takeaway: While Democrats maintain a relatively favorable view of their party's 2020 field, it doesn't reach the heights of enthusiasm seen in 2008.
