The chart shows the results of a survey of Palestinians on their views of the best way to achieve statehood. The results are as follows:
* **Armed struggle:** 45%
* **A combination (of methods):** 22%
* **Negotiations:** 15%
* **Nonviolent resistance:** 15%
* **Don't know (DK):** 3% 
The chart demonstrates that a plurality of Palestinians surveyed believe armed struggle is the best way to achieve statehood, but a larger percentage favor a combination of approaches or other non-violent methods.
