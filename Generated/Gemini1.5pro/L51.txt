The chart is about global opinions of the United States and its president.
- The top line shows the percentage of people in 24 countries who have a favorable view of the U.S. from 2016 to 2019. This number has remained relatively stable, hovering between 49% and 53%.
- The bottom line shows the percentage of people in those same countries who have confidence in the U.S. president during this time period. This line shows a dramatic drop from 2016 to 2017, coinciding with the transition from President Obama to President Trump. While confidence in the U.S. president has risen slightly since 2017, it remains much lower than the favorable view of the U.S. itself.
In conclusion, while global opinions of the United States remain relatively stable, there was a significant drop in confidence in the U.S. presidency coinciding with Trump's presidency. This suggests that while the world generally still views the U.S. favorably, there are concerns about its leadership under Trump.
